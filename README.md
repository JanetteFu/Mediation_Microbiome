# BVS_Med

This package is used to perform mediation effect selection for compositional mediators using a Bayesian joint model with the spike-and-slab priors. 

The package will be available when the paper "A Bayesian Joint Model for Compositional Mediation Effect Selection in Microbiome Data" gets published or upon request.
